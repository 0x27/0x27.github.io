  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I, like many other privacy conscious netizens who oppose mass surveillance, run a number of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/relays.html.en">tor relays</a> in support of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor project</a>. In the interests of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost">гла́сность</a>, I am listing the hashes and “names” of every tor relay I run here. If, in the future, for a research project or whatever, I run non-standard tor relays to do, 
say, traffic measuring, I will CLEARLY denote which ones are “doing wierd shit” so users can block them in their .torrc if they want to “opt out” of such statistical analysis (which 
may be done in the future solely in the interests of science). Such nodes will also CLEARLY have labelled “EXPERIMENT” in the relay name field.</p>

<p>Anyways, without further ado, here is links to the <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">globe</a> profiles for each of my relays.</p>

<p><a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/AC9803701F9EE18194D40B38E47CE4C68CF2F567">NationalCrimeAgency - AC9803701F9EE18194D40B38E47CE4C68CF2F567</a> (note: nothing to do with the actual UK National Crime Agency). Honest. Just happen to have a fun domain name 
pointing at that box.<br />
<a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/3BF32CED044BE4843978F14A316C769A47FE8481">Cyberia - 3BF32CED044BE4843978F14A316C769A47FE8481</a><br />
<a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/73067CD4ADD8A294BDA913DF45B63190A52B5F9F">ChickenLiver - 73067CD4ADD8A294BDA913DF45B63190A52B5F9F</a><br />
<a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/7DF22E97F13B28727D4FC7495E0933EB23012AE8">Neuromancer - 7DF22E97F13B28727D4FC7495E0933EB23012AE8</a><br />
<a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/D76252B1A6E9F01FC6772CFFB651056A2B54F92B">necronomicon - D76252B1A6E9F01FC6772CFFB651056A2B54F92B</a> (note: this hosts tor instance fell over for no fucking reason recently and the logs got fucked. I to this day 
don’t know why, absolutely no evidence of a compromise either. I probably just fucked something up.)<br />
<a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/670CCA3FDFCB6244ACA59112F823883F707F22CC">SnowCrash - 670CCA3FDFCB6244ACA59112F823883F707F22CC</a></p>

<p>Finally, something I am not quite comfortable with saying, but will say anyway. Running relays costs a non-zero sum of money every month. I, and many other relay operators, are doing 
this on shoestring budgets. So if you cannot run a relay for whatever reasons, you should perhaps consider donating to relay operators via <a href="http://donncha.is/">Donncha’s</a> amazing 
<a href="https://oniontip.com/">OnionTip</a> service, which collects donations and distributes them across participating relay operators depending on how much they are contributing to the Tor network.</p>
