  <article class="post-content">
    <p>So, occasionally I get up to doing speaky-thingies. Here is a list of previous talks and any associated video/media/slides associated with them.</p>

<h1 id="dublin-web-summit-2014---anonymous-and-lulzsec-the-politics-and-power-behind-the-mask">Dublin Web Summit 2014 - Anonymous and Lulzsec: The Politics and Power Behind the Mask.</h1>
<p>This was a panel discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman">Gabriella Coleman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DonnchaC">Donncha O Cearbhail</a> about Anonymous/LulzSec, the politics of the groups, and the general culture of them. </p>

<p>Was a good bit of craic. No video, sadly, but I will leave you with these two links… <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2014/11/10/web-summit-4-anonymous/">Irish Times article</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/web-summit/irish-student-hacker-theres-a-difference-between-trolling-and-being-an-ahole-on-the-internet-30724580.html">Irish Independant article</a></p>

<h1 id="ip-expo-europe-2014---collaboration-vs-confidentiality---what-do-the-hackers-say">IP Expo Europe 2014 - Collaboration vs. confidentiality - What do the hackers say?</h1>
<p>This was <a href="http://www.ipexpo.co.uk/Seminars/Identity-Data-Centric-Security/Thursday-09-October-2014/Collaboration-vs.-confidentiality-What-do-the-hackers-say">another panel</a>, wherin <a href="https://twitter.com/sleepycal">Cal Leeming</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/musalbas">Mustafa Al-Bassam</a>, and myself were discussing various things to do with cloud security and storage, amongst other things, with István Lám, the CEO of <a href="https://tresorit.com/">Tresorit</a>. No video again, because the IP Expo people apparently charge like a zillion quid for video or somesuch.</p>

<p>However, here is the sole <a href="https://twitter.com/Tresorit/status/520164126740733952">photo of the thing</a></p>

<h1 id="royal-court-london-2014---the-big-idea-in-conversation-with-lulzsec">Royal Court, London, 2014 - The Big Idea: In Conversation with LulzSec.</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/the-big-idea-teh-internet-is-serious-business">This</a> was a really, really odd one. Basically, myself and my fellow former cyberterrorists were on stage - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpGiLPF5BxQ">video</a> - chatting about the crimes we did, our motivations, and all that jazz, as part of a play called <a href="http://tehinternetisserious.biz/">Teh Internet is Serious Business</a>, which, by the way, was fucking amazing. Really unsure how to explain this particular talky thingy, but it was highly amusing.</p>

<h1 id="steelcon-2014---process-injection-with-python">SteelCon 2014 - Process Injection with Python</h1>
<p>This talk has <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/infodox/steelcon-2014-process-injection-with-python">slides</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOMZR5dl3Qk">video</a>! It was a talk I gave at <a href="http://www.steelcon.info/">SteelCon</a>, a hacker conference in Sheffield, UK. Doubtlessly one of the best conferences in the UK, way better than other, more corporate events (which are for sellouts :P)</p>

<h1 id="campuscon-2012---80211-client-exploitation-talk">CampusCon 2012 - 802.11 Client Exploitation Talk</h1>
<p>No slides or video, cannot find either, and the CampusCon site seems dead. The slides being gone is probably a good thing, because they were awful slides (worst powerpoint!), and the lack of video… A godsend - I was sleep deprived. Was also my first proper speaking gig! Massive props to the WIT Hacking Society though for giving me the chance!</p>
