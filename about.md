Hi, I am 0x27 (also known by about a dozen other nicknames), a student/developer who is using this blog/site thing to document various adventures in the wonderful world of software development, vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and various other computer science related (and otherwise) hobbies/interests. May occasionally contain rantings about various stuff as well.

Hopefully you find some of the things here interesting :)

You may reach me via the following email, but please use PGP, as it is not my mailserver:
