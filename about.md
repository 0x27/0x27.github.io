Hi, I am David D. Davidson (legally speaking, Darren Martyn), a student/developer/penetration tester who is using this blog/site thing to document various adventures in the wonderful world of software development, vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and various other computer science related (and otherwise) hobbies/interests. May occasionally contain rantings about various stuff as well. I work at [Xiphos Research][xiphosresearch], and study Forensic Science and Analysis in [Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology][gmit]. I also go under about a zillion different usernames/handles, depending on the time of day, day of week, and mood, and this is just one of them. My previous research is archived over at [Insecurety Research][insecurety]

The opinions and suchlike expressed on this site are my own opinion and not that of my employer, who fully respects my freedom of speech and does not have some retarded policy prohibiting me from speaking my mind or whatever.

Hopefully you find some of the things here interesting :)
