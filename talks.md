So, occasionally I get up to doing speaky-thingies. Here is a list of previous talks and any associated video/media/slides associated with them.

# Dublin Web Summit 2014 - Anonymous and Lulzsec: The Politics and Power Behind the Mask.
This was a panel discussion with [Gabriella Coleman][biella] and [Donncha O Cearbhail][donncha] about Anonymous/LulzSec, the politics of the groups, and the general culture of them. 

Was a good bit of craic. No video, sadly, but I will leave you with these two links... [Irish Times article][irishtimes] and [Irish Independant article][independent]

# IP Expo Europe 2014 - Collaboration vs. confidentiality - What do the hackers say?
This was [another panel][lolpanel], wherin [Cal Leeming][sleepycal], [Mustafa Al-Bassam][musalbas], and myself were discussing various things to do with cloud security and storage, amongst other things, with István Lám, the CEO of [Tresorit][tresorit]. No video again, because the IP Expo people apparently charge like a zillion quid for video or somesuch.

However, here is the sole [photo of the thing][lolphoto]
