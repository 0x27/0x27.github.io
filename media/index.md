I occasionally get involved with the media, either to comment on something, to collaborate on an article, or to participate in some kind of thing for television or something. On the suggestion of a friend, below are indexes of media shenanigans that I have either been involved in writing, been quoted in, or been filmed as part of. I am always more than happy to assist the media when it comes to enquiries about computer security topics and suchlike, so feel free to get in touch.

## Stuff I was involved in writing.
